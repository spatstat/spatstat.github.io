## Software documentation

To get help about `spatstat`, the main sources are:

- The *help* and *help.search* commands in *R*
-  [Quick Reference Guide](resources/spatstatQuickref.pdf) (pdf) listing all functions and datasets. This can be displayed in *R* by typing *help(spatstat)*
-   Complete [manual](resources/spatstatManual.pdf) for the package, containing all the help files (pdf, 1570 pages, 4.3Mb)

The Quick Reference Guide is good for browsing around for
functions if you are looking to do a specific task.

## Book

The recently published book [1] 
is a comprehensive course on analysing spatial point patterns
using the `spatstat` package. It is available as an eBook 
or in print.

>  Spatial Point Patterns: Methodology and Applications with *R*.
>  Chapman and Hall/CRC Press, 2015.
>  [Publisher's web page for book](http://www.crcpress.com/books/details/9781482210200/)
