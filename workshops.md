# Workshops

Periodically we offer workshops on spatstat, in which short classroom lectures are combined with hands-on exercises using spatstat.

The links to Past Workshops below contain lecturers' scripts, showing how various analyses are performed in spatstat, and lab exercises for participants to practise their skills.
