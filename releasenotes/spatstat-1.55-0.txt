# RELEASE NOTES

## spatstat 1.55-0

### 29 January 2018

   We thank 'AdriMaz' and Nicholas Read for contributions.

### OVERVIEW

 * Lurking variable plot for models fitted to several point patterns.

 * Improvements to code for class 'mppm'.

 * Improvements to leverage and influence diagnostics.

 * Improved summary information for funxy and distfun objects.

 * Bug fixes and improvements.

 * Removed old warnings and deprecated functions.

 * Nickname: "Stunned Mullet"

### NEW FUNCTIONS

 * contour.leverage.ppm  
    Method for 'contour' for leverage functions of class 'leverage.ppm'

 * lurking  
    New generic function for lurking variable plots.

 * lurking.ppp, lurking.ppm  
    These are equivalent to the original function 'lurking'.  
    They are now methods for the new generic 'lurking'.

 * lurking.mppm  
    New method for class 'mppm'  
    Lurking variable plot for models fitted to several point patterns.

 * print.lurk  
    Prints information about the object returned by the function 'lurking'  
    representing a lurking variable plot.

 * model.matrix.mppm  
    Method for 'model.matrix' for models of class 'mppm'.

 * test.crossing.psp,  test.selfcrossing.psp  
    Previously undocumented functions for testing whether segments cross.

### SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

 * predict.ppm  
    Now recognises the arguments 'dimyx' and 'eps' for specifying the  
    resolution of the grid of prediction points.

 * leverage.ppm, dfbetas.ppm  
    Increased the default resolution of the pixel images.  
    Spatial resolution can now be controlled by the arguments 'dimyx', 'eps'.

 * ppmInfluence  
    The result now belongs to class 'ppmInfluence', for which there are  
    methods for 'leverage', 'influence', 'dfbetas' which extract the  
    desired component.

 * plot.leverage.ppm  
    New argument 'what'.

 * persp.leverage.ppm  
    New arguments 'zlab' and 'what'.

 * as.im.leverage.ppm  
    New argument 'what'.

 * summary.funxy, summary.distfun  
    Printed information now includes a summary of the function values.

 * lurking.ppm  
    Accelerated.

 * "[.psp"  
    Accelerated.

 * clf.test, conspire, bounding.box, ksmooth.ppp, mpl, superimposePSP,  
    eval.hyper, smooth.fv, smooth.ppp, smooth.msr, rtoro, plot.kstest  
    These deprecated functions have now been removed.

 * bermantest  
    This deprecated function has now been removed.  
    Use berman.test instead.

 * kstest  
    This deprecated function has now been removed.  
    Use cdf.test instead.

 * plot.ppp  
    A very old warning, about the interpretation of the mark scale  
    as the circle diameter, is no longer printed.

### BUG FIXES

1. nnmap, nnmark  
     Values were incorrect if the resulting pixel image  
     had unequal numbers of rows and columns.  
     Fixed.

2. vcov.mppm  
     Format was incorrect (rows/columns were omitted) in some cases.  
     Fixed.

3. model.matrix.ppm, model.frame.ppm  
     Values were sometimes incorrect when applied to the result of subfits().  
     To be precise, if 'fit' was an mppm object fitted to a hyperframe  
     that included 'design covariates' (covariates that take a constant value  
     in each row of the hyperframe), and if 'futs <- subfits(fit)', then  
     model.matrix(futs[[i]]) gave incorrect values in the columns  
     corresponding to the design covariates.   
     Fixed.

4. model.matrix.ppm  
     The attribute 'assign' was omitted, in some cases.  
     Fixed.

5. simulate.dppm, simulate.detpointprocfamily  
     In dimensions higher than 2, the result was shifted so that  
     it was centred at the origin.  
     Fixed.

6. Smooth.ppp  
     Crashed if geometric=TRUE and there were several columns of marks.  
     Fixed.

7. simulate.dppm, simulate.detpointprocfamily  
     Crashed if nsim > 1 and the spatial dimension was not equal to 2.  
     Fixed.

8. plot.leverage.ppm  
     Contour line was annotated, which was not intended.  
     Fixed.

9. leverage.ppm  
     The leverage function was oversmoothed, when the model was fitted  
     with method="logi".  
     Fixed.
