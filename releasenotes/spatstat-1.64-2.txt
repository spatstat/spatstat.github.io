# RELEASE NOTES

## spatstat 1.64-2

### 04 November 2020

   We thank Corey Anderson, Andy Craig, Marcelino de la Cruz,
   Pavel Fibich, Kurt Hornik, Gopalan Nair, Yonatan Rosen
   and Rasmus Waagepetersen for contributions.

### OVERVIEW

 * spatstat now depends on the new package 'spatstat.sparse'.

 * spatstat now depends on R version 3.5.0 or later.

 * Changed default value of 'stringsAsFactors'.

 * predict.mppm now works for multitype point process models.

 * Improved handling of 'newdata' in predict.mppm.

 * More support for multi-dimensional patterns.

 * Bug fixes and minor improvements.

 * Version nickname: "Keeping up with the K-functions"

### NEW FUNCTIONS

 * intersect.boxx  
    Compute intersection of boxes in multi-dimensional space

 * scale.boxx, scale.ppx  
    Methods for 'scale' for boxes and patterns in multi-dimensional space

 * shift.boxx, shift.ppx  
    Methods for 'shift' for boxes and patterns in multi-dimensional space

 * is.boxx  
    Determine whether an object is a multidimensional box

### SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

 * package structure  
    We have removed some internal code from spatstat  
    to make a new sub-package 'spatstat.sparse',  
    which is now Required by 'spatstat'.

 * sumouter, quadform, bilinearform  
    These functions have been moved to the new sub-package 'spatstat.sparse'.

 * hyperframe, as.im.function  
    The formal default value of 'stringsAsFactors' has been changed to 'NULL'  
    to conform to changes in R. (The actual default value is TRUE for R < 4.1.0  
    and FALSE for R >= 4.1.0)

 * predict.mppm  
    Now supports multitype point process models.

 * predict.mppm  
    Improved handling of argument 'newdata'

 * densityHeat  
    Default behaviour has changed slightly.  
    New argument 'finespacing'.

 * density.lpp  
    Accelerated when the pattern contains duplicated points.

 * rotmean  
    The result now has the same 'unitname' as the input object X.  
    New argument 'adjust' controls the smoothing bandwidth.

 * sessionInfo  
    Output now includes a list of packages that are imported but not loaded.

 * rlabel  
    New argument 'group' specifies that the points are divided into  
    several groups, and that relabelling is applied within each group.

 * plot.psp  
    The code for 'style="width"' has been completely rewritten,  
    so that it no longer depends on plot.linim, and is much more efficient.  
    The formal argument list has been extended.

 * mincontrast  
    New argument 'action.bad.values' specifies what action is taken  
    when the summary function produces NA or NaN or infinite values.

 * sessionLibs  
    Package names are now sorted alphabetically.

 * [.linim  
    Accelerated.

 * integral.im  
    Accelerated in the case where 'domain' is a tessellation.

 * cbind.hyperframe  
    Row names are not altered (previously they were altered using 'make.names')

 * simulate.ppm  
    Now recognises the argument 'window' as an alternative to 'w'.

 * kppm  
    Improved numerical robustness.

 * Kcross, Gcross, Jcross  
    Function labels (shown on the plot legend) have been improved when i = j.

 * anova.mppm  
    Issues a warning when applied to random-effects models  
    (models fitted using the argument 'random').

 * [.ppx  
    New argument 'clip'

### BUG FIXES

 1. deviance.lppm, pseudoR2.lppm  
     Results were completely incorrect, due to a coding error.  
     Fixed.

 2. colourmap  
     If a colour map was applied to numbers lying outside the range of the  
     colour map, the wrong number of NA's was sometimes produced.  
     Fixed.

 3. Gest  
     If correction="rs" or correction="km", then both the reduced-sample  
     (border correction) and Kaplan-Meier corrected estimates were calculated.  
     [Spotted by Gopalan Nair.]  
     Fixed.

 4. Lcross.inhom, Kcross.inhom, Kmulti.inhom  
     The option 'correction="none"' was accepted but ignored.  
     [Spotted by Corey Anderson.]  
     Fixed.

 5. rMatClust, rThomas, rCauchy, rVarGamma  
     In cases where the model was degenerate (effectively a Poisson process)  
     the result did not have attributes 'Lambda' and 'parents'  
     even when the user requested them.  
     Fixed.

 6. model.matrix.mppm  
     Crashed with random-effects models.  
     Fixed.

 7. anova.mppm  
     Crashed with random-effects models.  
     Fixed.

 8. objsurf.kppm  
     Crashed if the model was fitted by Palm likelihood (method="palm")  
     or second order composite likelihood (method="clik2").  
     Fixed.

 9. MinkowskiSum  
     Crashed sometimes with an error message about 'sumconnected'.  
     Fixed.

10. simulate.rhohat  
     Crashed when applied to rhohat objects computed from data  
     on a linear network.  
     Fixed.

11. hyperframe  
     Crashed if the argument 'row.names' was given  
     and the hyperframe had exactly one row.  
     Fixed.
