# RELEASE NOTES

## spatstat 1.64-1

### 10 May 2020

   We thank Maximilian Vogtland and Maximilian Hesselbarth
   for contributions.

### OVERVIEW

 * Important bug fix in vcov.ppm

 * Relative risk estimation may include case weights.

 * Nickname: 'Help you I can, yes!'

### SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

 * rshift.ppp, rshift.splitppp  
    New argument 'nsim'.

 * relrisk.ppp  
    New argument 'weights'.

 * density.splitppp  
    New argument 'weights'.

### BUG FIXES

1. vcov.ppm  
     Variances were sometimes overestimated for Gibbs models.  
     That is, entries of the Fisher information matrix were underestimated,  
     because some contributions due to interaction were omitted  
     (due to a coding error).  
     Fixed.

2. density.ppp  
     Crashed when se=TRUE if there were multiple columns of 'weights'.  
     Fixed.

3. rbind.hyperframe  
     Crashed unless all arguments had the same number of rows.  
     (Spotted by Maximilian Vogtland).  
     Fixed.
