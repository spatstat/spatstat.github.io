### BUG FIXES

 1. cut.lpp  
     Crashed if the marks were a data frame or hyperframe.  
     Fixed.

 2. summary.lpp, print.summary.lpp  
     Output was garbled if the marks were a data frame or hyperframe.  
     Fixed.

 3. integral.linim  
     Crashed if the function had NA values.  
     Fixed.

 4. Tstat  
     Crashed if ratio=TRUE.  
     Fixed.

 5. intersect.owin  
     Ignored argument 'fatal' in some cases.  
     [Spotted by Agustin Lobo.]  
     Fixed.

 6. plot.tess  
     Crashed if do.col=TRUE and 'values' was a factor.  
     Fixed.

 7. pcf.ppp  
     Crashed if 'domain' was given and ratio=TRUE.  
     Fixed.

 8. "[<-.sparse3Darray"  
     Crashed if 'value' was one-dimensional  
     and the indices i, j, k specified a two-dimensional subset of x.  
     Fixed.

 9. plot.quad  
     Crashed if tiles=TRUE for a quadrature scheme  
     created by quadscheme(method="dirichlet", exact=TRUE).  
     Fixed.

10. bugtable  
     Crashed if there were no bugs!  
     Fixed.

11. sparse array code  
     An array bounds violation (segmentation fault) could occur.  
     Fixed.

12. internal code  
     Numerous internal bugs have been fixed.
